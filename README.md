## How to use

### Meaning of coefficients and time

Code uses coefficients, with norm of 0x100. This means that if you want in float epresentation Kp == 1.f, then you substitute k_p = 0x100.

This rule is used for all coefficients (k_p, k_i, k_d) and time as well.

This means, that when dt == 0x100 - integrator change would be, in float representation, exactly: input * k_i, differentiation component would be exactly (input - input_previous) * k_d.
